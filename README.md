# Flower_Recgnition
The "Flower Recognition CNN" is a project that uses a special kind of computer program to identify different types of flowers. In this project, you'll find information about why it was made and how it works. We used a collection of flower pictures to teach the program, and it can now recognize different flowers pretty well.
